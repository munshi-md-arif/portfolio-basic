# About

I am a MERN stack developer with a strong focus on backend development using Node.js. Currently working as a Junior Software Developer at Kestone Global, I am known for my strong sense of responsibility and punctuality in delivering high-quality software solutions.

Throughout my career, I have gained valuable experience in building backends for the Meta-commerce platform and a virtual event platform. I take pride in my ability to analyze complex problems and develop logical and efficient solutions. My passion lies in logical thinking and reasoning analysis, and I am constantly seeking opportunities to apply these skills in my work.

In addition to my backend expertise, I have also developed a mobile application called "YZ Events" using Flutter, which is available on both the App Store and Play Store. This experience has allowed me to enhance my understanding of the full mobile development lifecycle.

I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science from Lovely Professional University (2019-2023), where I not only gained a solid foundation in software development but also honed my skills in logical thinking and reasoning analysis. I believe that these skills are essential for tackling complex problems and delivering innovative solutions.

I am always eager to collaborate with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality solutions that meet business objectives. With a strong focus on continuous learning, I stay updated with the latest industry trends and technologies to enhance my skills and contribute to cutting-edge projects.

Feel free to connect with me for opportunities, collaborations, or to discuss anything related to software development. Let's leverage logical thinking and reasoning analysis to drive innovation and excellence in our work.
